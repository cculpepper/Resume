%\opening{To Whom it May Concern:} 
To Whom it May Concern:
 
%I am a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology in the 
%Computer Engineering program, graduating in May 2017. 
%I am seeking a position creating embedded software or hardware, designing
%circuits, or systems engineering. 
I started my post-collegiate career by expanding my previously established role
as a Systems Engineering Co-op at General Dynamics working in the subsurface
domain. As part of this role, I increased my knowledge of the subsurface domain,
gained experience working with other customer representatives, and gained a
solid fascination with that area. This particular position, while giving me
room to bring value to the company, left me wanting more hardware development
experience. I then transferred into hardware engineering as an Electrical
Engineer. This position has exposed me to the world of hardware design for
subsurface applications. I have proven my abilities by writing and executing
the qualification test plan for an inherited piece of hardware. While this is
closer, I would really like to be designing hardware. My previous Co-op at
SpaceX allowed me to design test articles, and my personal hobbies have given
me cause to design and create PCBs. I am looking for a position which will
allow me to flex my design muscles to create hardware, or the embedded software
which runs on said hardware. 
 
\noindent 
%As a student, I have completed many personal projects that have shown me that I
%enjoy the creation of embedded systems. In particular, I have received great
%enjoyment designing PCBs, writing the software and getting a working device at
%the end of the journey. My Coop at SpaceX has shown me that I enjoy working in
%the aerospace industry, probably because I read a lot of science-fiction as a
%kid. My coop experience has proved that I am a hard worker that can adapt to
%new situations quickly and with ease.
%PARAGRAPH  TWO:  Indicate why you are interested in the position, 
%the company, its products, services - above all, stress what  you 
%can  do  for  the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain 
%how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate  for 
%the  position.  If  you have practical work experience, point out 
%specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat 
%the  same  information  the reader will find in the resume. Refer 
%the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes 
%your  qualifications,  training,  and experiences. The purpose of 
%this section is to strengthen your resume  by  providing  details 
%which bring your experiences to life. 
 
%\noindent PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and  indicate  your 
%flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in 
%the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For 
%example,  state that you will be in the city where the company is 
\noindent Thank you for considering me for this position. 
 
Sincerely yours,
\\
Christopher R. Culpepper
